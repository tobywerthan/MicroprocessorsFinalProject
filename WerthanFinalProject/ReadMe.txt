Welcome to Pattern Matcher!!

MODE SELECTION:
To begin, toggle the mode by pressing Switch 1. There are three different modes: green (easy), blue (medium), red (hard). 
Once your desired mode is toggled, press Switch 2 to lock it in. 

PATTERN DISPLAY:
Once the mode is locked in, a random pattern is generated based on the selected mode. 
The LED will flash a white light twice, indicating the pattern is about to be displayed. 
There are two possible colors that will appear in the pattern, purple and yellow. 

USER INPUT:
After the pattern is displayed, the LED will flash a white light twice again prompting the user for an input.   
The user is prompted to press each switch in the correct order according to the displayed pattern.
The color purple is associated with Switch 1 and yellow is associated with Switch 2. 
For example, if the pattern displayed "yellow --> yellow --> purple", the correct user input would be "Switch 2 --> Switch 2 --> Switch 1".

GAME OVER: 
If the user inputs the correct pattern, the LED will flash green.
If the user inputs the incorrect pattern, the LED will flash red. 
To try again, simply press the reset button on the board.
